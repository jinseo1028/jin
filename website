<h3>
    In today's India, there's an interesting mix of old customs and new ideas shaping its culture. One noticeable change is how younger people are becoming more independent and open to Western influences. They're challenging the traditional views on things like showing affection in public and expressing sexuality. It has a sort of irony to it because India has a long history tied to the Kama Sutra, which is all about romance and relationships.

    Even in Bollywood movies, there's a shift. They now include more daring dance scenes and clothing choices. When it comes to relationships, even arranged marriages have adapted. People have more say in who they'll marry, and they get to know each other before tying the knot. Love marriages are also becoming more common.

    Western culture has made its way into India through the internet and global connections. This has led to more diversity and acceptance in a country with a rich cultural heritage. So, India today is a blend of tradition and modernity, influenced by the wider world.
